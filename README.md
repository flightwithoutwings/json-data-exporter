Built using Firebase Studio! (a rad program. Check it out!)

JSON Data Exporter was designed to work alongside Stockpile (an inventory app for digital comic books. Check it out [here](https://github.com/flightwithoutwings/stockpile)). JSON Data Exporter imports single or batch HTML files to parse and extract information from a specific comic book. It will then export into a JSON file. That file can be used for anything you see fit or you can upload it into Stockpile.
